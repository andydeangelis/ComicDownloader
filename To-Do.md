To-Do

Done - Add tracker (true/false) to _comicURLs table - Keep all URLs
Done - Modify batch download to only download if tracked = 'true'
Done - Modify delete function to change tracked to 'false' upon removal
Done - Dynamically create ComicInfo.xml file for each cbz file created (use ComicInfo.xsd 2.0 for reference) * Need to determine where to get metadata
Done - Add URLs/entries for existing Libraries not already listed
Done - Reindex/Recreate entire library (to create metadata files)
Add ability to download/search from GetComics.info or readcomiconline.ru
